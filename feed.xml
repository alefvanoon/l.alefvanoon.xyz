      <title>Using LibreDNS on iOS 14.x</title>
      <link href="https://libreops.cc/2020/11/07/libredns-ios/"/>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
          <p>We started our DoH/DoT service, <a href="https://libredns.gr">LibreDNS</a>, to secure (encrypt) our DNS queries and we made this service available to everybody, a year ago to this day!</p>
<p>We are really happy about the adaptation of LibreDNS and in some cases about providing a way to overcome censorship. Althouth we are not a big company/organization but a small team, we try to maintain these projects, keep them up to date and provide stable public services to everyone.</p>
<p>We depend on <a href="https://opencollective.com/libreops/">financial contributions</a> from people who trust and support us into running all of our services. We are always available and open for communication at our <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#libreops:matrix.org">Matrix channel</a>.</p>
<p>So, many thanks to all of you for supporting <strong>LibreDNS</strong>.</p>
<h2>Apple - iOS 14.x</h2>
<p>In apple devices, there was not an easy way to encrypt DNS queries and be protected against DNS leaks. The acceptated method was using cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 that creates a VPN to your mobile device and send your DNS queries throuth their infrastructure.</p>
<p>Recently we came upon this opensource project: <a href="https://github.com/kkk669/DNSecure">DNSecure</a> and we tried it, to see if it can be an alternative method to use <strong>LibreDNS</strong> service on iOS devices.</p>
<h2>Apple Store</h2>
<p>You can download the application from the apple store:
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dnsecure/id1533413232">dnsecure</a></p>
<p><em><strong>Notice:</strong> Requires iOS 14.0 or later.</em></p>
<h3>DoH Settings</h3>
<p>These are the settings to enable LibreDNS - DoH (DNS over https) service:</p>
<p>Servers: <strong>116.202.176.26</strong> <br>
Server URL: <code>https://doh.libredns.gr/dns-query</code></p>
<p><img alt="libredns-doh" src="/2020/11/07/libredns-ios/libredns-doh-dnsecure.png" /></p>
<p>or you can use our no-trackers endpoint:</p>
<p><code>https://doh.libredns.gr/ads</code></p>
<h3>DoT Settings</h3>
<p>To add the DoT (DNS over TLS) support:</p>
<p>Servers: <strong>116.202.176.26</strong> <br>
Server Name: <code>dot.libredns.gr</code></p>
<p><img alt="libredns-dot" src="/2020/11/07/libredns-ios/libredns-dot-dnsecure.png" /></p>
<h2>DNS - VPN</h2>
<p>It is time to enable this DNS service, so go to:</p>
<p><code>General --&gt; VPN &amp; Network --&gt; DNS</code></p>
<p>and enable DNSecure</p>
<p><img alt="libredns-dns-vpn" src="/2020/11/07/libredns-ios/libredns-vpn-ios.jpg" /></p>
<h3>DNS Leak Results</h3>
<p>To verify that your LibreDNS is running, visit
<a href="https://www.dnsleaktest.com/">dnsleattest</a> and run the test; you should see LibreDNS as your DNS server</p>

      <title>Phasing out our Diaspora pod</title>
      <link href="https://libreops.cc/2020/08/04/diaspora-eol/"/>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
          <p>Our diaspora pod, <a href="https://librenet.gr">librenet</a>, is the first service we ever set up and got online when the team that today is named LibreOps was initially formed.</p>
<p>The last couple of years our pod has significantly less activity and very few active users. Diaspora as a network has also less activity than it used to, partially because of its development team decision not to adopt the protocol which has been established as the open standard for federated services (ActivityPub). Although federated itself, it remains disconnected from the rest of the networks (what we call Fediverse). At the same time diaspora, as a software, was very difficult to administer and as our pod grew in size it became significantly slower. Effectively not allowing us to provide the level of service we want to the users.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, we believe that librenet.gr has run its course and <strong>we decided to terminate it at October 30th</strong>. We have huge appreciation for all the people that trusted us and this service for all these years. At the same time we still believe there is value in federated services as a big step towards a decentralized internet. That's why we maintain our own <a href="https://libretooth.gr/">mastodon instance</a>.</p>
<p>We are a small team, working voluntarily, in a non-hierarchical way and depend on <a href="https://opencollective.com/libreops/">financial contributions</a> from people who trust and support us into running all of our services. We are always available and open for communication at our <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#libreops:matrix.org">Matrix channel</a>.</p>

      <title>Two New LibreOps Services</title>
      <link href="https://libreops.cc/2020/04/21/two-new-librops-services/"/>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
          <p>We are happy and proud to launch our two new LibreOps services.</p>
<p>Our (Jitsi) Meet instance, the popular open source application that provides high quality, scalable video conferences. 
We hope that can people can communicate without logs but with privacy and security, especially these difficult COVID-19 times.
<a href="https://meet.libreops.cc" target="_blank"><img alt="Jitsi Meet" src="/2020/04/21/two-new-librops-services/meet.svg" class="w-25"></a></p>
<p>Our public DNS Resolver instance, named RadicalDNS. 
The motivation for this service was that the DoH/DoT encrypted DNS Service (LibreDNS), we're already operating, is unfortuanately not yet able to support legacy devices like phones, TVs or even home routers. Thus we wanted to provide and easy and useful public DNS alternative. The goal is to offer a public DNS service that people can use to maintain the secrecy of their DNS traffic, but also circumvent censorship. We don't keep logs, but we also filter ads and trackers.

      <title>doh-cli, a simple DoH client</title>
      <link href="https://libreops.cc/2019/12/25/doh-cli/"/>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
          <p>A couple months ago, we announced a public and free DNS service, so people can have encrypted DNS in their browsers and systems. We support both DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS and our DoH service has two endpoints, the default <code>/dns-query</code> and one for blocking trackers and ads <code>/ads</code>. You can visit <a href="https://libredns.gr/">our page</a> for more info.</p>
<h2>dns</h2>
<p>What is <strong>DNS</strong>?</p>
<p>Domain Name Service in a nutshell is when you are asking directions to find where Wikipedia is in the internet. Your browser does not know, so it will ask your computer. Your computer will ask your internet provider and your internet provider will ask someone else till they find the correct answer. In the end, your browser will know where to go and this is how you are visiting Wikipedia.</p>
<p>You need to trust all the above parties, to give you the correct answer and everybody knows that you are visiting Wikipedia.</p>
<h2>doh</h2>
<p>What is <strong>DoH</strong> (DNS Queries over HTTPS)?</p>
<p>It's the implementation of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484">RFC 8484</a>. This is a way for your browser to ask where to find Wikipedia, without exposing to everybody that you want to visit Wikipedia! Still you need someone to ask for directions, but now both your question and the answer are encrypted. So you have privacy.</p>
<h2>let's get technical</h2>
<p>What is <strong>RFC 8484</strong>?</p>
<p>In the above rfc, your client (eg. browser) asks your DNS via HTTP/2 representational state transfer (<strong>REST</strong>). DoH clients and servers need to sent a <code>application/dns-message</code> content (question/answer) and encode both the question and the answer in a <code>bace64url</code> message. Usually is GET, but POST is also supported on some servers.</p>
<h2>doh-cli</h2>
<p>So, today, we introduce <strong><a href="https://gitlab.com/libreops/doh-cli">doh-cli</a></strong>, a simple command line DoH client, written in python. You can use <strong>doh-cli</strong> as a binary client in your system. We support a few DoH public servers to test, and of course both LibreDNS DoH endpoints</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/libreops/doh-cli">Source Code</a>
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/doh-cli/">PyPi</a></p>
<h2>install it</h2>
<p>It is super easy</p>
<p><code>pip3 install doh-cli</code></p>
<p>or if python3 is your default python</p>
<p><code>pip install doh-cli</code></p>
<h2>howto use it?</h2>
<p>Just ask your favorite DoH server (default is <code>https://doh.libredns.gr/dns-query</code>)</p>
<p>eg.</p>
<p><code>doh-cli libredns.gr A</code></p>
<p>and use help to see all the options</p>
<p><code>doh-cli --help</code></p>
<h2>Why default output is json?</h2>
<p>With modern tools and with multiline output, it is best to support a serialized format so you can use doh-cli with your tools. But if you dont like it:</p>
<p><code>doh-cli --output plain libredns.gr A</code></p>
<p>You can see all the options and help, on the project's page.</p>

      <title>Mobile Privacy with DoH using Firefox and LibreDNS</title>
      <link href="https://libreops.cc/2019/12/21/libredns-mobile-firefox/"/>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
          <h2>DNS over HTTPS on Mobile</h2>
<p>Using DoH on mobile phones is not an easy task.
There are not many applications nor settings on the major operating systems for mobile devices that support DoH to resolve domain names.
Firefox provides an easy solution in order to use DoH on your phone with your browser.
In this article, we provide steps to do that with the help of Firefox and LibreDNS.</p>
<h2>Firefox on Mobile</h2>
<ul>
<li>Download Firefox for Mobile Devices.</li>
<li>Open Firefox and write in the address bar <code>about:config</code>.</li>
<li>Write in the search bar <code>network.trr.uri</code> and change the value of the preference to the URL of <strong>LibreDNS</strong> DoH endpoint: <a href="https://doh.libredns.gr/dns-query">https://doh.libredns.gr/dns-query</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="mobile1" src="/2019/12/21/libredns-mobile-firefox/mobile1.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Write in the search bar <code>network.trr.mode</code> and use <strong>2</strong> as value if you want to use LibreDNS as the default DoH provider and use your prexisting DNS provider as a fallback.
    Use <strong>3</strong> as a value if you want to use <strong>only</strong> LibreDNS without any fallback, for more options visit: <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Trusted_Recursive_Resolver">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Trusted_Recursive_Resolver</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="mobile2" src="/2019/12/21/libredns-mobile-firefox/mobile2.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>If you choose <strong>3</strong> in <code>network.trr.mode</code> you also need to add the following preference in <code>about:config</code>:
    Search for <code>network.trr.bootstrapAddress</code> in the address bar and change the value to <code>116.202.176.26</code> which is the IP address of LibreDNS.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="mobile3" src="/2019/12/21/libredns-mobile-firefox/mobile3.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Test the connection with <a href="https://dnsleaktest.com/">https://dnsleaktest.com/</a>, you should only get the following results:</li>
</ul>

      <title>LibreDNS, our new encrypted DNS service</title>
      <link href="https://libreops.cc/2019/10/14/libredns/"/>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
          <p><a href="https://libredns.gr" target="_blank"><img alt="LibreDNS" src="/2019/10/14/libredns/libredns.svg" class="w-50"></a></p>
<p>DNS is a very old and essential internet protocol, that we all use daily. But it was built without privacy and secrecy in mind. It lacks encryption, and though it's decentralized in theory, for most people it has a central point of failure (or censorship), their ISP's DNS provider.</p>
<p>In many places ISPs are vulnerable to state censorship and control, obliged to block certain domains or even do metadata retention. People have started using alternative services to get around that, but most well-known DNS providers are commercial entities with a business plan that is in contradiction with privacy.</p>
<p>DNS encrypted protocols have been on the rise lately, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS">DoH</a> (DNS over HTTPS) being the one with the biggest support, but also easy of use.</p>
<p><strong>Today we announce our own DNS service</strong>, a public encrypted DNS service, that people can use to maintain secrecy of their dns traffic and bypass censorship.</p>
<p>Its name is <a href="https://libredns.gr/">LibreDNS</a>.</p>

      <title>Running a Tor Relay</title>
      <link href="https://libreops.cc/2019/03/01/libreonion/"/>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
          <p>For those new on <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a>, it's a group of volunteer-operated servers that allows people to improve their privacy and security on the Internet, but also circumventing censorship. For a more detailed overview check the video at the end of the post.</p>
<p><img alt="libreonion" src="/2019/03/01/libreonion/libreonion.png" class="float-left"></p>
<p>In early February we started experimenting with running a Tor Relay. We chose to do that in a Greek IP address, to contribute to Tor's network diversity. At the momemnt there were only 40 Tor Relays running from Greece.</p>
<p>Almost a month later our relay has already generate 3.2TB of traffic. You can see some graphs below, and on <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#details/E8D114B3C78D8E6E7FEB1004650DD632C2143C9E">Tor Metrics</a> website.</p>
<p>We are really happy to contribute on Tor, and hopefully we will run more relays in the future. <strong>If you want to help us run more relays, you can <a href="https://liberapay.com/libreops/donate">donate</a>.</strong></p>
